# The goal of the application.
Please write a shopping list application.
The application should make everyday shopping easier by enabling the user to list down items to buy.
While shopping, the application should also help to track items that are already collected.

# How to compile and run the application.
Clone the project and Run.

I have tested this option and I did not experience any troubles.

1. Perform «pod install» in terminal and wait its completion.<br>
2. Build/Run project.<br>
3. If project can not be Built - need to fix issue which will provide Xcode. If it is the problem you can contact me and I will try to help to fix this issue. Google is also an option or any iOS engineer who is familiar with Xcode.<br>

# A few sentences about the overall architecture of the application.
Project is done in MVC pattern, because at the moment of assignment completion I am only about to start learning new design patters.

As a cloud service selected - Google Firestore.

# Functional requirements
- [x] Add items into a list
- [x] Delete items from a list
- [x] Check and uncheck items within a list
- [x] Share the cloud-stored data between application installs/instances. No need for user account support, just make the same data available for each install
/device running the application
- [ ] Optional: In order to make the application more usable, any other functionality may be added (e.g. multiple item-list support; item name autocompletion
based on previous item names; etc)
